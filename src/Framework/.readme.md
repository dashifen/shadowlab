# Framework Objects

The objects defined herein are, usually, nothing more than extension of
others which rely on Interfaces to inject their dependencies.  The dependency
injection container we're using herein can auto-wire it's injections but only
if we specify the exact set of objects to use via type hinting.  Since many
of our objects depend on Interfaces, rather than the objects which implement
them, these objects pave the way for our auto-wiring to work.

The alternative would be a long and somewhat arduous process of specifying
each object that our container would need to know how to construct.  Instead
of that, we concretize our dependencies in this namespace.
