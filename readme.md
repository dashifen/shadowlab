# Shadowlab 6th Edition

With the release of Shadowrun Sixth Edition, I decided to revive my Shadowlab project.  This is the repo for that revival.

## WordPress!?

Yup, this all runs within WordPress.  Mostly because I wanted to see what working with it as an application framework felt like instead of treating it like a site CMS as would be more typical.  Plus, it means that I can leverage all that WordPress has to offer with respect to database, custom post types, user roles and capabilities, etc. when building the Shadowlab.

## Installation

Bad news:  I rely on some of the things that I've purchased for my own use (FontAwesome, ACF, etc.) that require licenses.  Theoretically, if you had licenses for all that stuff, too, you could install this, install them, and run all my code in your own environment.  But, since that may not be the case, I don't suggest trying to get this going on your own; you'll need to re-program all the stuff that relies on those features.  

If you really want to try it, get in touch with me and we'll see if we can work it out.  

## Legal Stuff

So ... Shadowrun Sixth Edition is not mine.  Prior editions of Shadowrun have allowed fan related software development to occur, and I have no reason to suspect at this time that this edition will be any different.  Way back in 3rd edition (I think) the following was the typical disclaimer:

[The Topps Company, Inc.](http://www.topps.com/) has sole ownership of the names, logo, artwork, marks, photographs, sounds, audio, video and/or any proprietary material used in connection with the game [Shadowrun](https://www.shadowrunsixthworld.com/). The Topps Company, Inc. has granted permission to me to use such names, logos, artwork, marks and/or any proprietary materials for promotional and informational purposes within the Shadowlab but does not endorse, and is not affiliated with me in any official capacity whatsoever.

I've decided to license my code, i.e. everything here that's not otherwise WordPress's or Topps's stuff, with the WTFPL license.  So do whatever the fuck you want with the stuff that's mine, but make sure you respect the rest of this stuff that isn't.
