# Shadowlab 6th Edition

With the release of Shadowrun Sixth Edition, I decided to revive my Shadowlab project.  This is the repo for that revival.

## WordPress!?

Yup, this all runs within WordPress.  Mostly because I wanted to see what working with it as an application framework felt like instead of treating it like a site CMS as would be more typical.  I didn't bother to commit WordPress Core to this repo, but if you want to try and run all of this yourself, clone it and execute the `wp-install.sh` script to pull WordPress into the folder in the same way that I did.  Once you do that, install WordPress in the normal manner, log in, and enable both the Shadowlab theme and the Shadowlab plugin and you should be good to go.

## Legal Stuff

So ... Shadowrun Sixth Edition is not mine.  Prior editions of Shadowrun have allowed fan related software development to occur, and I have no reason to suspect at this time that this edition will be any different.  Way back in 3rd edition (I think) the following was the typical disclaimer:

[The Topps Company, Inc.](http://www.topps.com/) has sole ownership of the names, logo, artwork, marks, photographs, sounds, audio, video and/or any proprietary material used in connection with the game [Shadowrun](https://www.shadowrunsixthworld.com/). The Topps Company, Inc. has granted permission to me to use such names, logos, artwork, marks and/or any proprietary materials for promotional and informational purposes within the Shadowlab but does not endorse, and is not affiliated with me in any official capacity whatsoever.

I've decided to license my code, i.e. everything here that's not otherwise WordPress's or Topps's stuff, with the WTFPL license.  So do whatever the fuck you want with the stuff that's mine, but make sure you respect the rest of this stuff that isn't.
